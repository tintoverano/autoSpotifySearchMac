# triggerSpotifySearchMac

Kick off a Spotify Search with Selected Text on Mac 

I got tired of copy-pasting artist names to Spotify and do a search to find their albums, so I created this Automator workflow.

Before running the script install the Clickclick shell app from https://www.bluem.net/en/projects/cliclick/.

Don't forget to add a keyboard shortcut to trigger the script after selecting text on your Mac.
